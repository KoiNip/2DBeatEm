*file: WeaponSword.cs
*author: Corey Nambu
*class: CS 4700 â€“ Game Development 
*assignment: Program 4
*date last modified: 12/5/2022
* 
*purpose: This is the weapon class, it is responsible for holding all the attacks the player can use.
* each attack is an object of the attack class, stored in a 6D array for easy indexing. It may seem unusual,
* but formatting the attacks in this way allows us to completley avoid iterating through an array to see which
* attack is being called. We thoroghly looked for different ways to hold the attacks, but every other way we could
* think of would require a loop iterating through an array in some way. With this implementation, we can call an attack
* by simply saying weapon.attacks[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6] in the player controller instead of looping.
* This implementation also allows for super easy attack creation, creating a new attack for the player is literally one line of code
* It does take time to make good attacks as we have to carefully balance the player and its weapon
*
