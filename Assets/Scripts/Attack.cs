*purpose: This is the attack class, it defines the stats for an attack. This class was created
* to allow us to easily create more attacks without having to write a lot of code. This class holds
* all the stats we need for an attack, including damage, knockback, hitbox position and size, attack uptime
* and endlag, and whether the attack is the last attack in the combo, allowing for a new combo to start
*
