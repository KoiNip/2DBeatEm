NOTES:
When you playtest, be sure to set the game preview window to Full HD (1920x1080), this will let the health bar show up.
The Main Menu scene should be loaded when you use the game, if it isn't you can find it in the Assets folder not nested in any subfolders. Double click the Main Menu scene to open it and you can press play to playtest the game.
If you find any trouble, this project can instead be downloaded at our github:
